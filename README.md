This project was a part of a school course about emerging topics in machine learning. Here we try to understand and reimplement the original paper :

We provide the data used for the implementation as well as the colab project that you can run and play with !

Finally here is a link to the slides we presented at the end of this course, they can be used as a breif introduction into the subject.
